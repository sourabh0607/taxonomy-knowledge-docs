Session Dialogue

## Service Domain - Session Dialogue
#### serviceDomainRoleDefinition:
The customer contact dialogue handling capability can provide highly structured orchestration to streamline a customer interaction by consolidating and presenting customer related data in context. It can also use the session to gather additional customer intelligence. In a more advance implementation the customer interaction capabilities can be integrated into an automated self/service context in addition to the more conventional assisted service model. The structured customer dialogue can include tasks to check for other business activities that can be built into the exchange for example, delivering pending communications, sales/marketing attempts, capturing intelligence/triggers, updating relationship status/details, product fulfillment (such as synchronizing customer-side data). The facility can be designed to support multi-channel/multi-device deployments

Contact Handler

## Service Domain - Contact Handler
#### serviceDomainRoleDefinition:
BIAN defines a customer contact as the overarching structure handling a customer interaction from start to end.
